**Setting Page**
This page will allow users to enter and save their name. Once they click the saved button, a "Settings saved" text appears at the bottom.

**Task Detail**
Currently does not hold anything, yet.

**User Profile Page**
This page will hold the user's name input, which when saved, will display "Welcome to {userName}'s Tasks!" in the Main Activity. That part of the code, commented out because there is an error around the @Override and the onResume(). I haven't been to debug it yet.
